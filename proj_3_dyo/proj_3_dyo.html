		<p> Oslo is the capital and largest city of Norway. It was once known as Christiania or Kristiania. It is located in the southeastern region of the country, at the mouth of the Oslo Fjord. Oslo's initial location was east of the Aker River. King Harald Hardraade created the city in 1050, and Haakon V built the Akershus fortification around 1300. Christian IV of Denmark-Norway erected a new town farther west, under the walls of the Akershus fortification, after the city was devastated by fire in 1624. He named it Christiania. The city of Christiania surpassed its rival, the west-coast port of Bergen, as Norway's largest and most significant city in the nineteenth century, thanks to the absorption of surrounding communities.

		<p>Until the end of 2005, the Oslo City Museum was a private organization. It joined two other museums, the Intercultural Museum and the Theatre Museum, in the newly constituted Oslo Museum in 2006. Frogner Manor is now the home of the Oslo Museum. The Oslo City Museum includes a large library dedicated to documenting the history of both the city of Oslo and the former municipality of Aker. The museum's art collection and photo collection with Oslo motifs and portraits are particularly valuable. The museum houses one of Norway's largest and most important photographic collections. Aside from it, the museum has an art collection of about 1,000 paintings and 6,000 other works.

		<p>Viking Ship Museum: The Viking Ship Museum, which is part of the University of Oslo's Cultural History Museum, features incredible artifacts from four separate Viking burial sites surrounding the Oslo Fjord. The Oseberg Ship shines brightly in the museum on the Bygdy Peninsula. This 9th-century burial ship was discovered in 1904-05 and is as good as new because it had been sealed in waterproof and airtight mud for so long. Similar ships from Tune and Gokstad, as well as all the objects discovered buried with them, such as beds, tiny boats, a complete wagon, textiles, and other valuables discovered in Viking burials, are no less interesting. The film Vikings Alive is displayed on the walls and ceiling as you go through, providing additional background on Viking burial traditions.

		<p>After visiting the sculpture park, go to the Vigeland Museum, which is housed in a Neoclassical building on the southern edge. This lovely house was created in the 1920s as Gustav Vigeland's atelier and home after he agreed to dedicate his works to the city. After his death in 1947, the building was turned into a museum, keeping his private apartment on the third story, which he occupied from 1924 to 1943 and is mostly furnished with pieces he designed. The museum also offers you a thorough feel of Vigeland's technique, revealing the plaster models for the sculptures in the park, preparatory sketches, casts, and many of Vigeland's early pieces, as well as being the space where he worked.

		<p>Oslo is Norway's economic and political capital. In addition, the city serves as a crossroads for Norwegian trade, finance, industry, and shipping. In Europe, it is a significant center for maritime industries and trade. Many marine companies call the city home, including some of the world's major shipping corporations, shipbrokers, and maritime insurance brokers. Oslo is part of the Council of Europe's and European Commission's intercultural cities program as a pilot city. In 2008, the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network ranked Oslo as a "Beta World City" in research conducted by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network. In the European Cities Index, it was placed first in terms of quality of life among European metropolitan cities.
